Lessons Learned From This Assignment:
-I spent more time on this project in the styling instead of the coding of the project to be displayed
-I know now that styling comes last, and the hard coding of what appears on the page must come first
-I also learned the importance of pseudocoding the steps to reach what will be displayed on the page before starting or attempting to start the code
-If I were to use these steps again, I feel confident I would have created a working game.
